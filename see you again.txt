Its been a long day without you my friend
And Ill tell you all about it when I see you again
Weve come a long way from where we began
Oh Ill tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn who knew all the planes we flew
Good things weve been through
That Ill be standing right here
long time no see
But something told me that it wouldnt last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place
How could we not talk about family when familys all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
Its been a long day without you my friend
And Ill tell you all about it when I see you again
Weve come a long way from where we began
