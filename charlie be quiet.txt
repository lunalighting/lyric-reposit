Charlie, be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love, she's gonna run, run away
I'm not making the same mistake
Won't be putting my heart on display
I'll just water my feelings down
I'm not going out looking dumb
Telling all my friends how you're the one
Those words never leaving my mouth
loving you girl
What am I gonna do now
When you touch me?
'Cause it's all getting too loud
Charlie, be quiet, don't make a sound
You've got to lower the noise a littlе bit now
If she knows you're in love, shе's gonna run, run aw
