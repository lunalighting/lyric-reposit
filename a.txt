I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed
that we were going
i can't really loving you
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmmm, mmmm
I loved you dangerously
Usually, I hold the power with both my hands
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only
one place this could lead
Cause you are the fire, I'm gasoline
I love you, I love you, I love you
I loved you dangerously
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
Oh now, knew
we would crash at the speed
that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmmm, mmmm
Ooh, I loved you dangerously
Ooh ooh, I loved you dangerously
